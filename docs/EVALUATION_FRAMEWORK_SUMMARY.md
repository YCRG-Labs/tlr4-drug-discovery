# Comprehensive Model Evaluation Framework Implementation

## Task 14: Implement comprehensive model evaluation framework

### ✅ COMPLETED

This task has been successfully implemented with a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes all required components from the specification.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ModelEvaluator Class
**File**: `src/tlr4_binding/ml_components/evaluator.py`

**New Features Added**:
- **Learning Curves Generation**: `generate_learning_curves()` method that creates learning curves showing training and validation performance across different training set sizes
- **Validation Curves Generation**: `generate_validation_curves()` method for hyperparameter tuning visualization
- **Cross-Validation Framework**: `cross_validate_model()` method for robust model evaluation
- **Statistical Significance Testing**: Enhanced `statistical_significance_test()` with paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
- **Comprehensive Performance Metrics**: R², RMSE, MAE, Spearman correlation, Pearson correlation, MAPE, SMAPE, and residual analysis

### 2. ComprehensiveEvaluator Class
**File**: `src/tlr4_binding/ml_components/comprehensive_evaluator.py`

**Features**:
- **Unified Evaluation Interface**: Evaluates traditional ML, deep learning, GNN, and ensemble models consistently
- **Automated Model Comparison**: Generates comprehensive performance comparison tables and plots
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performs pairwise statistical significance tests between all models
- **Visualization Suite**: Creates publication-ready plots for model comparison, cross-validation, and statistical significance
- **Report Generation**: Produces detailed evaluation reports in JSON and text formats
- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with existing model trainers in the project

### 3. Demo and Testing Framework
**Files**: 
- `demo_comprehensive_evaluation.py` - Full demonstration script
- `standalone_evaluation_test.py` - Standalone test without dependencies
- `tests/test_comprehensive_evaluation.py` - Comprehensive pytest test suite

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ R², RMSE, MAE, and Spearman Correlation
All core regression metrics are calculated and reported:
- R² Score (coefficient of determination)
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Spearman correlation coefficient
- Pearson correlation coefficient
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

### ✅ Statistical Significance Testing
- Paired t-tests between model performances
- Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (non-parametric alternative)
- Confidence level configuration (default 95%)
- P-value reporting and significance determination

### ✅ Learning Curves and Validation Curves
- **Learning Curves**: Show model performance vs training set size
- **Validation Curves**: Show performance vs hyperparameter values
- Error bars showing standard deviation across CV folds
- Publication-ready plots with proper styling

### ✅ Comprehensive Performance Comparison
- Multi-model comparison tables sorted by performance
- Visual comparison plots (bar charts, box plots)
- Cross-validation performance comparison with error bars
- Statistical significance heatmaps
- Performance distribution analysis

### ✅ Integration with Existing Models
- Works with traditional ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR, LightGBM)
- Compatible with deep learning models (MLP, CNN, Transformer)
- Supports ensemble models (stacked, weighted)
- Ready for GNN model integration

## Usage Examples

### Basic Model Evaluation
```python
from tlr4_binding.ml_components.evaluator import ModelEvaluator

evaluator = ModelEvaluator()
metrics = evaluator.evaluate(y_true, y_pred, "My Model")
print(f"R² Score: {metrics.metrics['r2']:.4f}")
```

### Cross-Validation Evaluation
```python
cv_results = evaluator.cross_validate_model(model, X, y, "Model Name", cv=5)
print(f"Mean R²: {cv_results['r2']['mean']:.4f} ± {cv_results['r2']['std']:.4f}")
```

### Learning Curves
```python
curve_data = evaluator.generate_learning_curves(
    model, X, y, "Model Name", 
    save_path="learning_curves.png"
)
```

### Comprehensive Evaluation
```python
from tlr4_binding.ml_components.comprehensive_evaluator import ComprehensiveEvaluator

evaluator = ComprehensiveEvaluator(output_dir="results/evaluation")
results = evaluator.evaluate_all_models(
    X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test
)
```

## Test Results

## Next Steps

The comprehensive model evaluation framework is now ready for use. To integrate it with the existing project:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed (`scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `numpy`)

2. **Run Evaluation**: Use the demo script to test the framework:
   ```bash
   python3 standalone_evaluation_test.py
   ```

3. **Integrate with Models**: The framework is designed to work with the existing model trainers in the project

4. **Generate Reports**: Use the comprehensive evaluator to generate detailed evaluation reports for your models

The evaluation framework provides a solid foundation for model assessment and comparison, meeting all the requirements specified in Task 14.
