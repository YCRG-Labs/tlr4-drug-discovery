# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) binding affinities based on molecular structure features. TLR4 is a critical target for treating inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and accurate binding prediction can accelerate drug discovery by reducing the time and cost of identifying potent TLR4 modulators. The system will integrate molecular docking data from AutoDock Vina with molecular descriptors extracted from PDBQT files using PyMOL to create a predictive model for binding free energies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Processing and Feature Extraction

**User Story:** As a computational biologist, I want to extract molecular descriptors from PDBQT files, so that I can use structural features as input for machine learning models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDBQT file is provided THEN the system SHALL extract molecular descriptors including molecular weight, LogP, number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and topological polar surface area
2. WHEN processing molecular structures THEN the system SHALL use PyMOL to calculate 3D structural features including radius of gyration, surface area, and volume
3. WHEN extracting features THEN the system SHALL handle all 48 compounds in the binding-data/raw/pdbqt directory
4. IF a PDBQT file is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other files
5. WHEN feature extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL output a structured dataset with compound names, molecular descriptors, and corresponding binding affinities

### Requirement 2: Binding Affinity Data Integration

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to integrate AutoDock Vina binding results with molecular features, so that I can create a comprehensive dataset for model training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing binding data THEN the system SHALL extract the best binding affinity (lowest energy) for each compound from processed_logs.csv
2. WHEN multiple binding modes exist for a compound THEN the system SHALL select the mode with the most favorable (most negative) affinity value
3. WHEN integrating data THEN the system SHALL match compound names between PDBQT files and CSV records
4. IF compound names don't match exactly THEN the system SHALL implement fuzzy matching to handle naming variations
5. WHEN data integration is complete THEN the system SHALL create a unified dataset with molecular features and target binding affinities

### Requirement 3: Machine Learning Model Development

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to train multiple ML models on the molecular feature dataset, so that I can identify the best approach for predicting TLR4 binding affinities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL implement at least three different algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Gradient Boosting
2. WHEN preparing data THEN the system SHALL split the dataset into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets using stratified sampling
3. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL perform hyperparameter optimization using cross-validation
4. WHEN evaluating models THEN the system SHALL calculate RÂ², RMSE, and MAE metrics for each model
5. WHEN model training is complete THEN the system SHALL identify the best-performing model based on validation metrics

### Requirement 4: Feature Importance and Model Interpretability

**User Story:** As a medicinal chemist, I want to understand which molecular features most influence TLR4 binding, so that I can design better drug candidates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing trained models THEN the system SHALL calculate feature importance scores for all molecular descriptors
2. WHEN generating interpretability results THEN the system SHALL create visualizations showing the top 10 most important features
3. WHEN explaining predictions THEN the system SHALL provide SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for individual predictions
4. WHEN analyzing feature relationships THEN the system SHALL generate correlation matrices and feature interaction plots
5. WHEN interpretability analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL produce a summary report of key structural factors affecting binding

### Requirement 5: Model Validation and Performance Assessment

**User Story:** As a computational researcher, I want to validate model performance on unseen data, so that I can assess the reliability of binding predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating models THEN the system SHALL perform k-fold cross-validation (k=5) on the training dataset
2. WHEN testing final models THEN the system SHALL evaluate performance on the held-out test set
3. WHEN assessing predictions THEN the system SHALL generate scatter plots of predicted vs. actual binding affinities
4. WHEN calculating confidence intervals THEN the system SHALL provide prediction uncertainty estimates
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive performance report with statistical significance tests

### Requirement 6: Prediction Interface and Output

**User Story:** As a drug discovery researcher, I want to use the trained model to predict binding affinities for new compounds, so that I can prioritize candidates for experimental testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL accept new PDBQT files as input
2. WHEN processing new compounds THEN the system SHALL extract the same molecular features used in training
3. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL output binding affinity estimates with confidence intervals
4. WHEN saving results THEN the system SHALL export predictions in CSV format with compound identifiers
5. WHEN prediction is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a ranking of compounds by predicted binding strength

### Requirement 7: Data Quality and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a bioinformatics analyst, I want robust error handling and data validation, so that the pipeline can handle diverse molecular datasets reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing input files THEN the system SHALL validate PDBQT file format and structure
2. WHEN extracting features THEN the system SHALL handle missing or invalid molecular properties gracefully
3. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL detect and handle outliers in the binding affinity data
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages and continue processing where possible
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a data quality report highlighting any issues or limitations
